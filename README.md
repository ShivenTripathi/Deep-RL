# DQN Agent to play Chrome Dino Game

A Deep Convolutional Network is used to get environment state from raw image data from Chrome Browser. An OpenAI gym environment had been modified to be able to connect with browser game and training notebook. From the predicted state variables, the agent explores the environment with epsilon-greedy policy. To increase sample efficiency and independently distribute the states for training, Experience Replay had also been used.

### Installation
- Start by cloning the repository.

`$ git clone https://github.com/ShivenTripathi/Hack2Learn.git`

- Install gym-env by following instructions in Hack2Learn/gym-chrome-dino/

### Usage
- Use Hack2Learn/DQN Agent to play Chrome Dino.ipynb to train, test your model. 
- You can save and load the model to view result from the the last cells.

### Requirements
- Use the requirements.txt file

`conda install --file requirements.txt`
